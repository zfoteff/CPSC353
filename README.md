CPSC 353: Applied Cryptography
==============================
All files and projects created during Spring 2021 semester of CPSC 353 at
Gonzaga University

## Project 1: Digital Coin-Flipping
Project 1 implements the transposition cipher

## Project 2-5:
In class book assignments.

## Project 6: Generating D for RSA
This project has us work through the mathematics and then the sage implementation of generating the private key, d, for RSA encryption algorithm.

## Project 7: RSA
Project 7 has us implement the RSA encryption algorithm with a selectable key size.

## Project 8: Primitive roots
Book work problems regarding primitive roots.

## Project 9: El Gamal
Project 9 has us implement the El Gamal encryption algorithm.

## Project 10: Diffie-Hellman
Project 10 has us implement the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange method in sage.

## Project 11: Levenshtein Distance Comparision Table
Project 11 is a table that compares the Levenshtein Distance of all encryption methods implemented thus far in class

## Project 12: MD2 Hash Function
Project 12 has us implement the MD2 hash function that will hash a message, then return its 16 bit hash
